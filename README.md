# JSON Web Tokens en ASP.NET Core 6
Examples that show how to authenticate users in ASP.NET Core 6 using JSON Web Tokens(JWT), to handle authentication in applications.

In this way, when the user wants to authenticate, he sends his login data to the server, it generates the JWT and sends it to the client application, then in each request the client sends this token that the server uses to verify that the user is correctly authenticated and allowing the user to access routes, services or resources that are only allowed with the proper token. This token is used as a method of authentication and authorization by the client application against the server that hosts the resource.
